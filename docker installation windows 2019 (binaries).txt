To install server and client binaries, perform the following steps:

1.	Download the static binary archive. Go to 	https://download.docker.com/win/static/stable/x86_64 and select the latest version from 	the list.

2. 	Run the following PowerShell commands to install and extract the archive to your program 	files:

 	PS C:\> Expand-Archive /path/to/docker-20.10.9.zip -DestinationPath $Env:ProgramFiles

3.	Register the service and start the Docker Engine:

 	PS C:\> &$Env:ProgramFiles\Docker\dockerd --register-service
 	PS C:\> Start-Service docker

4. 	Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

	PS C:\> &$Env:ProgramFiles\Docker\docker run hello-world:nanoserver

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.
